# 5d manifold map

Just a quick level that demonstrates a slightly more complex example of Marathon's 2.5-D engine's by-product feature of "5-D space".

The simple example is a ring with two overlapping hallways that should clip, but don't.

Here, four seperate rings are connected by four center floors that are each connected to four seperate rooms each. Gives the impression that you're looking at a room with four collumns, but getting lost in an un-painted room is easy in this configuration.

Ironically, the first time I tried this particular configuration, I made a msitake in assembling the rings, and ended up not with four, but two double-rings. I much prefer this 4-ring variety.
