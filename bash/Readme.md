## License

BSD like, to be determined later.

No Warranty, accept at your own risk

## Profile

Publicly distributable elements of my bash profile are available for your use or inspection. Tested somewhat on macOS systems, no clue why it fails or succeeds in anything else. 

### Installation

1. Clone the repo somewhere on your machine.
2. `cd` to the `profile` directory
3. Run `install.sh`
4. Check your `.bashrc` file for correctness.

### Updates

TBD later
